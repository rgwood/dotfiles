# Hadoop and Friends

# Install

Used DigitalOcean's [install guide for Hadoop](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-hadoop-in-stand-alone-mode-on-ubuntu-16-04)

## SQL Stuff

Apache Hive and Spark SQL are kinda similar, but they have different underlying implementations.

Hive converts SQL to Hadoop jobs. Largely useful for batch processing.

Spark SQL is a part of Spark (duh) and is largely compatible with Hive. Kinda accomplishes the same goals as Hive, but within Spark?
